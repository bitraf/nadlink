    <h1>Unofficial NAD Link protocol specification</h1>
    <p>This is a decription of how to use the NAD Link RCA connectors at the
    back of most NAD equipment, using a PC parallell port.</p>
    <p>The NAD Link uses a slightly modified version of the NEC remote control
    protocol, where 0V represents <tt>pulse</tt>, and +5V represents <tt>flat</tt>.</p>
    <h2>The NEC Receiver protocol</h2>
    <p><small>Derived from <a
        href='http://www.sbprojects.com/knowledge/ir/nec.htm'>sbprojects.com</a></small>.</p>
    <h3>1. Preamble</h3>
    <pre>
  9000 &mu;s pulse
  4500 &mu;s flat</pre>
    <h3>2. Address</h3>
    <p>The (8 bit) address is transferred using pulse distance encoding with the least
    signficant bit going first over the wire.  Afterwards, the bitwise negation
    is sent. <b>Note:</b> This is where NAD diverges slightly from the NEC spec.
    More on this later.</p>
    <p>One-bits are encoded like this:</p>
    <pre>
  560 &mu;s pulse
 1690 &mu;s flat</pre>
    <p>Zero-bits are encoded like this:</p>
    <pre>
  560 &mu;s pulse
  560 &mu;s flat</pre>
    <p>Example: Assume the address is <tt>00110101</tt>.  In this case
    <tt>00110101&nbsp;11001010</tt> is transmitted (space added for readability - not
    a delay).  Sending the bitwise negation
    after the actual address means that there are always 8 ones and 8 zeroes
    being transmitted, so all addresses take the same amount ot time to tramsit,
    despite the use of pulse distance encoding.</p>
    <h3>3. Command</h3>
    <p>The command is also 8 bits, and is transmitted in the same manner as
    the address.  First directly, then inverted.</p>
    <h3>4. Command terminator</h3>
    <pre>
  560 &mu;s pulse
42020 &mu;s flat</pre>
    <h3>5. Repeat</h3>
    <p>Send zero or more of this to indicate that the remote control button is
    being held down.</p>
    <pre>
 9000 &mu;s pulse
 2250 &mu;s flat
  560 &mu;s pulse
98190 &mu;s flat</pre>
    <p>(Total time: 110ms)</p>

    <h3>Differences in the NAD implementation</h3>
    <p>NAD does not send exactly the inverted address as the second byte.
    Instead, typically 1 or 2 bits are not inverted.  This is not a problem,
    since it is included in the <tt>.ir</tt> files available at the NAD
    website.</p>
    <h2>NAD remote control codes</h2>
    <p>At the time of writing, NAD publishes the codes for its remote controls
    at <a
      href='http://www.nadelectronics.com/software'>[nadelectronics.com]</a>.  I
    have also mirrored the <a href='nadcodes.zip'>Creston remote controller
      codes</a>, since I managed to reverse engineer the file format.  I also
    made <a href='irparse.c'>C program to decode the files</a>, as well as a <a
      href='nadlink.c'>C program to control a NAD 912 receiver via TCP</a></p>
